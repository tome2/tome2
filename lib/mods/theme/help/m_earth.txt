#####R === ToME Magic - Earth School ===

The earth school of magic contains spells where the element of earth is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the
Impenetrable Earth" which contains all the earth school spells within its
bindings.

Worshipping Tulkas, Yavanna Kementari or Aule also gives the ability to cast 
spells from the earth school, at a level of 4/5, 1/2, or 1/3, respectively, 
of your prayer level. E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 
10, a worshipper of Tulkas can cast up to level 8 earth school spells, 
whereas a worshipper of Yavanna can cast up to level 5 earth school spells 
and a worshipper of Aule can cast up to level 3 earth school spells.
