#####R === ToME Magic - Mana School ===

The mana school of magic contains spells where the raw force of magic is used
to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of Magical 
Energy" which contains all the mana school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping Eru Iluvatar or Varda Elentari also gives the ability to cast spells 
from the mana school at a level of 1/2 or 1/4, respectively, of your prayer level. 
E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, Eru worshippers can cast 
up to level 5 mana school spells whereas Varda worshippers can cast up to level 3
mana school spells.

#####sMana Spells
There are four spells available for the mana school. These spells are:
1. [[[[[sManathrust] (school level 1)
   Conjures up mana into a powerful bolt.
   The damage is irresistible and will increase with spell level.
2. [[[[[sRemove Curses] (school level 10)
   Removes curses of worn objects.
   At spell level 20, removes heavy curses.
3. [[[[[sElemental Shield] (school level 20)
   Provides resistance to the four basic elements.
4. [[[[[sDisruption Shield] (school level 45)
   Uses mana instead of hitpoints to take damage.
   At spell level 5 switches to Globe of Invulnerability.
   The spell breaks as soon as a melee, shooting, throwing or magical skill
   action is attempted, and lasts only a short time otherwise.
