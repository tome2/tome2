#####GAule's Magic
Worshipping Aule the Smith gives the adventurer access to a set of special
spells that come directly from the hands of Aule. These spells use your piety
to cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Aule will 
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for his help without offending him! 

There is a special book - called the "The Earth Tome of Aule" which 
contains instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Eru will 
grant. There are four prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BFirebrand] (Level 1)
   Imbues your melee weapon with fire to deal more damage.
   At level 15 it spreads over a 1 radius zone around your target.
   At level 30 it deals holy fire damage.
2. [[[[[BEnchant Weapon] (Level 10)
   Tries to enchant a weapon to-hit.
   At level 5 it also enchants to-dam.
   At level 45 it enhances the special powers of magical weapons.
   The might of the enchantment increases with level.
3. [[[[[BEnchant Armour] (Level 15)
   Tries to enchant a piece of armour.
   At level 20 it also enchants to-hit and to-dam.
   At level 40 it enhances the special powers of magical armour
   The might of the enchantment increases with level.
4. [[[[[BChild of Aule] (Level 20)
   Summons a levelled Dwarven warrior to help you battle the forces
   of Morgoth.
   
Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to his specific magic, Aule will also assist with your ability to
use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you 
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:

    *****m_earth.txt*0[Earth School] at 1/3 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_fire.txt*0[Fire School] at 3/5 the Prayer skill level.
The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
