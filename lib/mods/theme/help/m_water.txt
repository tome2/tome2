#####R === ToME Magic - Water School ===

The water school of magic contains spells where the element of water is
used to create the final spell effect. There are rumours of a "Tome of the
Everrunning Wave" which contains all the water school spells within its
bindings.

Worshipping Yavanna Kementari or Ulmo also gives the ability to cast spells
from the water school at a level of 1/2 or 3/5, respectively, of your prayer 
level. E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 10, a Yavanna 
worshipper can cast up to level 5 water school spells, whereas an Ulmo
worshipper can cast up to level 6 water school spells.

#####bWater Spells
There are four spells available for the water school. These Spells are:
1. [[[[[bGeyser] (school level 1)
