#####RThe Guide to the Gods.

#####G1. Introduction
        Everybody likes to have a little helping hand now and then.  What
could be better than having a god on your side?  But it's not quite that easy.
The gods won't help just any mortal who calls for help.  You have to give them
a little something too.

#####G2. How Do I Get in on This?
        When you start a character, you get a choice of whether or not you
wish to begin worshipping a God (unless you're something like a priest - they
*must* start with a God to worship). If you do choose to be a follower of one
of the Gods, you will gain certain abilities provided you do not do things
that displease them. The measure of how happy your God is with you is your
Piety - the Pt stat is your measure of Piety. Different actions will allow you
to gain or lose Piety over time. You can change your mind about whom (if 
anyone) to worship during the game by finding an *****tome_faq.txt*04[altar] of that God.

#####G3. What about spells?
God-granted spells are also known as prayers, and are cast using Piety instead
of Mana. God-spells can be increased in level by improving either your Prayer
or Spell-power skill. The chance of successfully invoking a prayer depends
on the Prayer skill and your wisdom.

Each God also grants access to standard magical spell schools; which school(s)
vary depending on the Gods' individual preferences. Spells from these schools
are cast using Mana, not Piety; and success depends on your intelligence, not
your wisdom.

#####G4.  So, Who Are These Gods?
