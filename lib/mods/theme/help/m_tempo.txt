#####R === ToME Magic - Temporal School ===

The temporal school of magic contains spells where magic is used to meddle
in the relationship between time and space. There are rumours of a "Tome of
the Time" which contains all the temporal school spells within its bindings.

Worshipping Yavanna Kementari or Mandos also gives the ability to cast spells
from the temporal school at a level of 1/6 or 1/4, respectively, of your prayer 
level. E.g. if the skill "Spirituality: Prayer" is at level 12, a worshipper
of Yavanna can cast up to level 2 temporal school spells, whereas a worshipper
of Mandos can cast up to level 3 temporal school spells.
