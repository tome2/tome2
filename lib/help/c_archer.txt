#####R=== Archers ===

#####GDescription
Archers are to bows what warriors are to melee. They are the best class
around with any bow/crossbow/sling/boomerang. 

Needing a lot of ammo, they will learn early how to make it from junk found
in the dungeons. They also gain, at skill level 20, the unique ability to make 
their arrows/bolts/shots pierce through monsters!

~~~~~03|Creating Ammo
#####GCreating Ammo
Archers automatically gain the *****ability.txt*07[Ammo Creation] ability when they reach character 
level 2. (Other classes can purchase this ability when they have enough skill 
points.) This ability is accessed via the 'm' command.  The first type of 
ammo you can make is sling ammo (pebbles or shots); as you increase in skill
you'll be able to make other arrows (bow ammo) or bolts (crossbow ammo).

Shots (or other sling ammo) are created from rubble piles found in the dungeons
and other places.  To make shots, stand next to a rubble pile, activate the
ammo creation ability from the 'm' menu, select 's'hots, then specify the
direction to the rubble pile, which will be consumed during the ammo creation.
Arrows or bolts are made from "junk" items ('~' symbol, such as shards of
pottery) that you can find in the dungeons and other places.  To make arrows or
bolts, assuming you have sufficient Archery skill, you must have the junk item
in your inventory or on the ground at your feet.  Specify the junk item after
selecting 'a'rrows or 'b'olts from the ammo creation menu, and it will be
consumed and replaced with a stack of ammo.
