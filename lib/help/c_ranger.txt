#####R=== Rangers ===

#####GDescription
Rangers are warrior-mages, devoted to nature. They are good fighters 
and quite effective with bows; their magic often allows them to avoid
the worst of situations, but they have only a mild chance of resisting
magical effects and are not terribly stealthy.

They have access to the schools of *****m_divin.txt*0[Divination], *****m_convey.txt*0[Conveyance] and *****m_nature.txt*0[Nature] magic.
