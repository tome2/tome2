~~~~~111|Debug|Command descriptions 
#####R===  Command Descriptions ===

        The following command descriptions are listed as the command name
plus the "underlying command" key. Then comes a brief description of the
command. Some commands use the "repeat count" to automatically repeat the
command several times, while others use the "repeat count" as an "argument",
for example, commands which need a "quantity" will use the "repeat count"
instead of asking for a quantity, allowing the use of "0d" for "drop all".
Commands which ask for a quantity will convert any "letters" into the
maximal legal value.
