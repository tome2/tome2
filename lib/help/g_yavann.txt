#####GYavanna's Magic
Worshipping Yavanna gives the adventurer access to a set of special spells
that come directly from the hands of Yavanna. These spells use your piety to
cast rather than your spellpoints, and the level of spells that Yavanna will
permit you to use is determined by your Prayer skill - how skillful you are
in asking for her help without offending her!

There is a special book called the "Forest Tome of Yavanna" which contains
instructions for the procedure for each of the prayers Yavanna will grant.
There are five prayers all told, which are:
1. [[[[[BCharm Animal] (Level 1)
   Tries to tame animals in a zone around your target.
2. [[[[[BGrow Grass] (Level 10)
   Creates a floor of grass around you. While on grass and praying,
   a worshipper of Yavanna will know a greater regeneration rate.
3. [[[[[BTree Roots] (Level 15)
   Creates roots deep in the floor from your feet, making you more stable and
   able to do better attacks, but preventing any movement (even teleportation).
   It also makes you recover from stunning almost immediately.
4. [[[[[BWater Bite] (Level 20)
   Imbues your melee weapon with a natural stream of water.
   At level 25, it spreads over a 1 radius zone around your target.
5. [[[[[BUproot] (Level 35)
   Awakes a tree to help you battle the forces of Morgoth.

Each of these spells can be increased in level both by improving your Prayer
skill, and by improving your Spell-power skill.

In addition to her specific magic, Yavanna will also assist with your ability
to use some magic from the "standard" schools, in relation to how skilled you
are at Prayer. These schools are as follows:
    *****m_earth.txt*0[Earth School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_nature.txt*0[Nature School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_water.txt*0[Water School] at 1/2 the Prayer skill level.
    *****m_tempo.txt*0[Temporal School] at 1/6 the Prayer skill level.
The spells from these schools are all cast using your normal spellpoints.
