##### Objects 500 to 511 are "Special Artifacts" #####

# These objects do not specify "full names" because the artifact name
# is added in "obj-desc.c" based on the artifact index ("i_ptr->name1").
#
# These objects do specify a "base name", which is used when the object
# is "aware" (always true for lites)
#
# The Lites (and the One Ring) specify "physical colors", which
# over-ride the "flavor" colors, if any.  Note that the "One Ring"
# also has a specific check for "unknown" in which it changes its
# name to "a plain gold ring".  See "object1.c"
#
# Note that ALL artifacts are given "IGNORE_ACID/ELEC/FIRE/COLD",
# so we do not need to specify that here.
#
# Note that the "INSTA_ART" flag is used to prevent these objects from
# being created without also turning them into artifacts.  This flag
# must be specified both here and in the artifact template.
#
# The only reason for having six different "ring" templates and three
# different "amulet" templates is to allow each "special artifact" to
# have a different "color" and "flavor", and also to allow the use of
# special "base names" (such as "Necklace").
