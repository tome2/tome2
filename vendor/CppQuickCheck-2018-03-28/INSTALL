CppQuickCheck is built using the CMake tool: http://www.cmake.org so you must have that installed on your system. In addition, the library uses significant functionality from the popular BOOST library: http://www.boost.org so you must have that installed to be able to use CppQuickCheck.

To build and install the library, invoke the following commands:

    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install

This will install CppQuickCheck into the default install location (usually /usr/local/include). See the cmake homepage for more details on different options.

CppQuickCheck is a header only library. You do not need to link any libraries to use it. When building, it will build the examples but these will not be installed.
